OMG, so I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Pabrik Gula and holy crap, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Like, seriously, what even was that? I mean, some moments were so intense I could barely keep up, but I was also half asleep 'cause, you know, tired AF. Anyway, the whole sugar factory setting was kinda cool, totally gave me Charlie and the Chocolate Factory vibes, but in a super twisted, sugar-coated nightmare.
